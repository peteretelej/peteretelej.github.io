# AI Prompts & Development Rules

A curated collection of prompts, rules, and configurations I use with various AI coding assistants and development tools. These have been refined through practical use across multiple projects.

## Core Development Principles

### Communication Guidelines
- Answer questions directly first - don't immediately start implementing unless explicitly asked
- For research questions, provide analysis based on knowledge rather than running tests
- Never use emojis in logs, documentation, or markdown files

### Code Quality Standards
- Write simple, clear and concise code - prefer simplicity over complexity
- Avoid comments - code should be self-documenting
- Keep documentation concise, clear, well-structured and technical
- Avoid verbosity, marketing fluff, or unnecessary elaboration

### Project Workflow
- Before implementing changes, prefer discussing first
- In new sessions, review existing docs (README.md, docs/design.md, _docs/design.md)
- If project has scripts/pre-push script, run it after completing major phases
- For Python projects, prefer uv commands

## Task Management Patterns

### Implementation Phases
- Break work into phases with checklists
- Each phase MUST end with a checklist item to mark the phase items as done
- Add final code quality phase to simplify and improve newly added code
- In last phase, compare current branch to main for bugs, smells, or improvement opportunities
- Marking checklist items as completed IS CRITICAL

### Planning Structure
Plans should contain:
- Clear intro on the problem being solved
- Current state description
- Proposed changes (high level)
- Implementation details
- Phases with checkboxes
- Conclusion on proposed changes and impact

## Technology-Specific Rules

### Go Development
```
- Simple, idiomatic Go
- No comments - self-explanatory code
- Follow existing patterns
- Use standard library when possible
- Run `go test ./...` and `go build ./...` to validate
```

### Frontend (Next.js/React)
```
- Always use pnpm for package management
- Use shadcn CLI for UI components: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component]`
- Never install external libraries unless user agrees
- Never use `use client` unless user agrees
- Never create Next.js API endpoints (use backend API instead)
```

### Python Development
```
- NEVER use python commands directly - always use `uv`
- Framework: FastAPI or Litestar with async programming
- Use Pydantic models for validation
- Follow async best practices
- Never publish to pypi or commit on user's behalf
```

## Tmux Integration Patterns

### Session Management
```bash
# Check if session exists, start if needed
tmux has-session -t project-dev 2>/dev/null || ./dev.sh

# Send commands to specific panes
tmux send-keys -t project-dev:dev.1 "command" Enter
tmux send-keys -t project-dev:dev.2 "command" Enter

# Capture output
tmux capture-pane -t project-dev:dev.1 -p
tmux capture-pane -t project-dev:dev.2 -p
```

### Development Server Pattern
- Pane 1: Main development server (hot reload)
- Pane 2: Manual commands and testing
- Use capture-pane to monitor status, never run manual builds

## Agent Specialization Examples

### Architecture Agent
```
Responsibilities:
- Design and document system architecture
- Write clear, technical design documents
- Use ASCII art for design diagrams
- Keep architecture simple and maintainable
```

### Frontend Developer Agent
```
Specialties: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind 4, TypeScript
- Always use pnpm
- Use shadcn CLI for components, use shadcn cli to add new components
- If project prefers SSR, never use `use client` without explicit consent
- Follow existing code patterns
```

### Backend Developer Agent
```
Go: Focus on REST endpoints, RSS management, caching
Python: FastAPI/Litestar, async programming, document conversion
- Use appropriate package managers (go mod, uv)
- Follow language-specific best practices
```

## Git & Version Control

### Commit Guidelines
- Never git commit or git add on user's behalf
- When asked for commit/PR messages, provide only the message text
- Include relevant file paths in documentation for easy reference

### Branch Management
- Always compare current branch to main for improvements
- Run pre-push scripts when available
- Validate with linting/typechecking before completion

## Security & Quality

### Development Standards
- Avoid unnecessary complexity and premature optimization
- Use relative paths when referencing repository files
- Never introduce code that exposes secrets or keys
- Follow security best practices consistently

### Testing Requirements
- High test coverage targets
- Test all input methods and error conditions
- Validate with appropriate tools before commits
- Run all available quality checks

## MCP Server Integration

### Available Servers
- `diffchunk`: For reviewing large commits
- `directory-indexer`: For troubleshooting customer cases

Always use these when available for their specific use cases.
